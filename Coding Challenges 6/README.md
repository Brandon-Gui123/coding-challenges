# Coding Challenges 5

This folder contains my solution to all challenges in [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1gg-J3gCKM/).

All these challenges will be done using C++ and compiled with GCC.

I will be working on this challenges using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which I have already set up on my laptop.

By the way, [challenge 5](https://github.com/Brandon-Gui123/coding-challenges/tree/main/Coding%20Challenges%205) is also done using C++, GCC and WSL.
